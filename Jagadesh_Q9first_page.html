    <h1 title="Kidney Dialysis">Dialysis</h1>

    <p align="justify">Dialysis is a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly. It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned.Normally, the kidneys filter the blood, removing harmful waste products and excess fluid and turning these into urine to be passed out of the body.This is referred to as renal replacement therapy. The first successful dialysis was performed in 1943.</p>

    <p align="justify">Dialysis may need to be initiated when there is a sudden rapid loss of kidney function, known as acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), or when a gradual decline in kidney function, chronic kidney disease, reaches stage 5. Stage 5 chronic renal failure is reached when the glomerular filtration rate is 10-15% of normal, creatinine clearance is less than 10 mL per minute and uremia is present.Dialysis is used as a temporary measure in either acute kidney injury or in those awaiting kidney transplant and as a permanent measure in those for whom a transplant is not indicated or not possible.</p>

    <p>There are 2 main types of dialysis:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Haemodialysis</li>
        <li>Peritoneal dialysis</li>
    </ul>
